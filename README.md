**Try to use Pandas as much as possible.**

### Ending Thoughts:

It turns out some puzzles are not pandas-solvable, while map-puzzles are my favorite.

Day 23's puzzles were solved by hand, as it took less efforts than a programmable solution considering my main aim is to practice Pandas. Similar to Day 24, in which I found the most important clues by hand and simply ran the code to verify.

First time Advent of Code, relaxed in the first half, then puzzles were getting harder and harder. The shortest path (day 15) one was a real killer, borrowed&learned some ideas. Also, the coordinate shift (day 19) consumed a lot mental power to imagine and solve. Probably no more such kind of event, as it has taken a lot of time and energy from my spare time. 

Nicing ending mood though, a big relief.
